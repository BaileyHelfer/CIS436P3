# Cat Breed Information App
Welcome to the Cat Breed Information App! This app was created by Bailey Helfer, Cody Lovelace, and Chrisopher Hillusing. This app uses Android development tools and allows users to search for different cat breeds and get information about them. The app uses the Cat API (https://thecatapi.com/) to retrieve data and images of cat breeds, and makes use of Android fragments and the Volley library to call the API.

## Technologies Used
- Android development tools (e.g. Android Studio)
- Java programming language
- Android fragments
- Volley library
- Cat API (https://thecatapi.com/)

## Getting Started
To use the Cat Breed Information App, you will need to obtain an API key from the Cat API website (https://thecatapi.com/). Follow the instructions on the website to get a free API key, which you can use to make up to 10,000 requests to the API.

Once you have an API key, you can download the app and run it on your Android device. The app will prompt you to enter your API key, which will be used to make requests to the API using Volley.

## Takeaways and Lessons Learned
- Android fragments are a useful way to break up the user interface of an app into - smaller, reusable pieces.
- The Volley library is a powerful tool for making HTTP requests in Android, and can be used to easily call APIs like the Cat API.
- Working with APIs and parsing JSON data is an important skill for Android developers.
